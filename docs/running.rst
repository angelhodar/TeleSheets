Running App
===========

Once everything is configured to your needs, to run the app you just have to execute the ``bot.py`` module. If using pipenv:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pipenv shell
    $ python bot.py

Or with just a single command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pipenv run python bot.py


If you want to stop it just press Ctrl + C. Now its your turn to deploy the app in the cloud service of your choice
to keep it running 24/7!
